## RESTful API

> Version **42** of listingslab cuts to the chase. It's just a JSON API. Speak JSON or forever hold your peace

Yeh, we decided that making a frontend was too much effort, so this iteration of the listingslab site is a RESTFUL API

```bash
# Clone repo
cd <working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/listingslab-software/restful-api.git

# If you want to  rename the project, do it here
git clone https://github.com/listingslab-software/restful-api.git new-project-name

```
